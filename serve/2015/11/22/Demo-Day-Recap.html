<p><a href="http://ziptrip.firebaseapp.com">Plan your own trip here</a></p>

<p>This past Friday my cohort wrapped up our Iron Yard experience with Demo Day. My project, Ziptrip, went first and we had a pretty good presentation and got
a lot of positive feedback from the employers there. It was great validation to see such positive reactions to a project I’ve worked so hard on the past three weeks.</p>

<p>The way our demo day was set up, we had all eleven groups present their 5 minute demos,
then afterwards, the employers who were attending were able to walk around and talk to
the students about their projects. Every group had their own table, so it was easy
to find us.</p>

<p>Demo Day really shines in that companies that I had previously never heard of and
probably would never have discovered myself come out to introduce themselves. They were
able to talk to me about their company, what they did, and then ask me about my project
and my experience. I was able to make a few contacts at companies that sound pretty cool!
I’ll be following up this weekend to hopefully set up next steps at a few places and
see what happens.</p>

<p>There are several companies that I’m still interested in that weren’t at Demo Day but
have openings on their site, so I’ll be looking into those as well.</p>
