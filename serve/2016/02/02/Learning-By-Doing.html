  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This weekend I learned a LOT of Rails. I had the great opportunity to help a friend of mine on a fairly large project she owns. When she initially asked if I’d be able to help her out, I wasn’t sure if I had the knowledge and experience with Rails to actually be able to contribute to a codebase that people regularly use. Turns out that I totally can!</p>

<p>I spent the weekend setting up bulk emails and adding buttons to the front end so it’s easy to send emails through the app. It was definitely a good assignment to get my hands in a lot of places. I was in the mailers, creating those, adding methods to a controller, reading through the models and schema to see the kind of information different objects had to be used in emails, and I spent time creating an email skeleton in the views. Finally I spent a lot of time troubleshooting in the config and initialize folders. I definitely plan to keep working through Rails Tutorial as its a much more gentle introduction and gives a lot of background information which is pretty nice to have. All in all, definitely a really productive weekend!</p>

<p>In other news, I start a new job tomorrow. I accepted a junior full stack position with AT&amp;T that I’m incredibly excited about. The backend is in Perl and I’ll be doing front end work with the standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack and working with MySQL databases. I’m looking forward to adding a lot of new skills to my resume and getting my hands dirty with a lot of different things!</p>
