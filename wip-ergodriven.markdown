I like to stand while I work. I get a lot more done, and I generally feel much less lethargic and stiff at the end of the day. Now that I mostly work from home, this is pretty easy for me to do. I have a sit to stand desk that I can just push a button and it adjusts to whatever height I want. It's awesome.

However, an expensive sit to stand desk isn't an option for a lot of people, and it wasn't for me at my last job. We were in a fairly traditional office setup, with ~30 of us in a large room with half height cubicles. There are plenty of pros and cons to this, but one of the biggest cons was that it didn't really allow me to stand at work unless I either forked over hundreds of dollars for a fancy sit to stand desk topper, or had a hodge podge arrangement of boxes on my desk to elevate my monitor and keyboard when I wanted to stand.

I wanted something that was relatively inexpensive, but would allow me to switch between sitting and standing at work, all while not looking horrible. I also wanted something that had a place for my external keyboard and mouse, and then a higher ledge where I would place my monitor or laptop.

Eventually I found the Spark desk, by ErgoDriven. Basically, its ~20 bucks shipped from Amazon and its an intentional looking two tiered cardboard standing desk option that sits on tops of your existing desk. I bought it on a whim because of the price, but I ended up REALLY liking it.

For the niche its trying to fill, the Spark is awesome. It comes as precut cardboard and you do a bit of cardboard origami to get it constructed, its not actually as hard as it sounds, and took me about 15-20 minutes to set it up. Once its set up, you definitely won't want to be tearing it down and reconstructing regularly.

One of my major concerns about the desk was wether or not it would be sturdy enough to support an external monitor vs a lighter laptop that it was probably designed for. I've had zero issues with sturdiness and I bang on my keyboard and lean on it like anything else. It's constructed in a very smart way, and I always feel like its very balanced.
