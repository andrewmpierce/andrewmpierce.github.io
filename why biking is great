## On The Iron Yard and why biking is great

### September 5, 2015

It's officially been a week at The Iron Yard and so far it's been a great
experience. I've been learning an immense amount and putting in a lot of work,
but it's been incredibly enjoyable. Whenever I'm programming and working through
a tough problem, I feel like I'm on Adderrall, even though I haven't taken anything
I'm incredibly focused and block out everything that's going on in our lab space
very easily.

I find myself putting in an immense amount of time, but I don't even notice.
Generally I'm up at about 7:30, am in class by 9:00, and am working in some
capacity until at least 8:00 at night. On the weekends I'm probably spending 5-6
hours a day at the minimum.

Luckily for myself, I happen to live near Southpoint and have been biking the 7
or so miles to TIY on the Tobacco Trail. It's a walking/bike path the whole way
and I find I really enjoy the pure physicality of it after having such a 'mental'
day.
