I'm a talented junior developer seeking exciting opportunities in Raleigh-Durham, NC. If you want to talk to me about volunteering or working on new projects, reach out! I'm a nice guy and odds are good I'd love to talk to you about your endeavors.

Currently, I'm working as a Jr. Web Application Developer at AT&T.

I'm a recent graduate of The Iron Yard code school in Durham, NC. At The Iron Yard I studied Python and learned both web development with Django and data science using tools like pandas, Numpy, sklearn, and SciPy. Since leaving The Iron Yard I've continued to grow my abilities and have have worked with Perl, Ruby, and the Rails framework. I'm excited about technology and try to use my powers for good.
