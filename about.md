<p>Hi! I am a software engineer based in Durham, NC. I went to undergrad at UNC Chapel Hill (Go Heels, Go America!), then went to an intensive code school called The Iron Yard. Afterwards I transitioned to a role as a software engineer at AT&T for a little over a year, where I worked on internal tools.

Now I'm freelancing full time and working on some personal projects, as well as having a position at UNC Coding Bootcamp as a Teaching Assistant.</p>
