<p>Hi! I am a software engineer based in NYC and I recently moved from Durham, NC.
I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in 2015, then worked as a web developer at AT&T,
taught at the UNC Coding Boot Camp for a semester, and most recently worked at a
Rails consultancy called SciMed before I moved to New York. </p>
