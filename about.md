I'm a talented junior developer currently seeking exciting opportunities in Raleigh-Durham, NC.

I'm a recent graduate of The Iron Yard code school in Durham, NC. At The Iron Yard I studied Python and learned both web development with Django and data science using tools like pandas, Numpy, sklearn, and SciPy. Since leaving The Iron Yard I've continued to grow my abilities and have have worked with Perl, Ruby, and the Rails framework. I'm excited about technology and try to use my powers for good.
