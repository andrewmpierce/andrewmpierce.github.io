# Who am I and how did I get here?

I am a 2015 graduate of UNC Chapel Hill's biology program. At some point in my senior year I became fascinated with programming and computer science and the elegant complexity and logic involved with the discipline. As I didn't have enough semesters left at UNC to pursue a double major or minor in computer science, I decided to enroll in the Python course at The Iron Yard code school in Durham, NC to pursue this interest and augment my biology background before entering the workforce.

 I began in the course in late August of 2015 and will graduate in November of 2015. So far it has been an exciting experience and I find myself loving the long hours involved in learning a language as elegant as I find Python to be.



## On a more personal note

I'm a Wilmington native and a Durham transplant. My first love has always been science and logic, tempered with a fascination with history and culture. My biology knowledge base is well grounded, with knowledge of genetics, ecology, micro and macro biology. However, my personal favorites areas have always been ecology and how the 'big picture' of biology works. My all time favorite course I took at UNC was Plant Diversity, followed closely by Local Flora of the Piedmont. I've always found botany to be an especially fascinating aspect of the natural world.
