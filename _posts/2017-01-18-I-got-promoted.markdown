I just heard that I'm being promoted from a junior level developer to a mid level developer. It feels pretty good! I've worked very hard over the past year or
so at AT&T and it's really nice to see that paying off. My job won't be changing at all, I'm just getting a moderate raise and my title is changing. I'll still
be on the same team, and doing the same work.

I don't have a whole lot to say about this really. I guess it means I'm doing exceptionally well at work? I recognize that every company and every person has a
different definition of junior vs mid vs senior level, so the actual title doesn't really make a big impact on me. Either way, this is pretty cool I think!
