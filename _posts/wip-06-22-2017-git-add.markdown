git add

git commit

git push


These three commands are what I like to call the git trifecta. Basically everyone who's used git in any capacity has at least used these three commands. They may not know what each one is really doing, but most developers know that you can do this and magically your code is on Github. Today we are going to go over the first one of the three, git add.

Git keeps track of changes in your code through it's index. Without getting too involved, its a snapshot of the current state of your code. When you run the command git add, you are updating the index to include the relevant code you added.
