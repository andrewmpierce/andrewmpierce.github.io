So I had a bit of a change of plans from what I had set out with yesterday. I ended up having an interview today! It was scheduled yesterday, so I ended up changing gears to prep for it with all the limited time I had available. So unfortunately, very little Rails was done yesterday or today (although a little bit was!). Instead I spent a lot of time pouring over Perl and learning the baby step basics of Javascript.

What I learned yesterday:
Yesterday I learned a lot of Perl! I incorporated Unit Testing using Test::Simple and also starting learning some basic Javascript so I'd have something to talk about today. I was able to find a Javascript assignment from the Rails course that I worked on and was able to learn the basics of how to incorporate Javascript into a Rails application, which was definitely nice to keep working with Rails in a small way.

What I'm going to do today:
This is being posted fairly late, but I intend to spend the rest of the night working on a code sample for the position I interviewed for today.

What I expect to learn:
How to put out an awesome code sample doing things I haven't done before with Perl!
