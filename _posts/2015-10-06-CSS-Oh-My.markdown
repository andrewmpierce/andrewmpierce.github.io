## My Crash Course in HTML and CSS
Yesterday, we learned the very basics of HTML and CSS and had a pretty fun
assignment where we replicated a basic webpage in HTML and CSS and then used CSS
exclusively to replicate a button. I'll attach images and the link to my CodePen
if you want to see my code. As I've mentioned before, I think this is
very different skillset, it takes an incredible amount of patience to tweak these
elements until they are pixel perfect, or as close you intend to get there. I definitely
have a lot to learn when it comes to creating anything that a user will ever see,
but it's been a fun exercise so far and I was really blown away by some of the
designs I saw. The animations on some examples were amazing! I'm guessing this is
the power of Javascript right?


![This is my CodePen](http://codepen.io/andrewmpierce/)

This is the webpage I was supposed to replicate, it's very '98, if I do say so.

<img src="/images/sonnet.png" width="300" height="250" >

This is a screenshot of what I created, it's certainly not perfect, but for my
first foray into creating something in HTML and CSS from scratch, I don't think
it's too bad! The dimensions are a little warped because this is just a portion
of the full image.

<img src="/images/mysonnet.png" width="300" height="250" >

Here is the button that I mentioned we replicated.

<img src="/images/button.png" width="200" height="100" >

Here is my attempt. Again, not pixel perfect, but it was certainly a lot of fun
to play with.
