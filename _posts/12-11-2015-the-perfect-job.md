I officially have a week left at The Iron Yard. Time has really flown by! At this point,
my next step is job searching. Overall, I feel really good about it. I've worked incredibly hard over the past three months to become a great junior developer and I feel like I have a great skill set to offer my future employer. I love what I'm doing, I love learning, and I love a challenge.

That being said, I worry. What is the actual best job for me? I've thought about it
in quite a bit of my free time and I've come to a few conclusions.

I want to be in a challenging atmosphere. The Iron Yard was hard, I learned
an incredible amount every single day, and then had to apply it that night. I loved it.
I have learned more in the past three months than I ever have in that kind of time
frame and that's because I was pushed every day. I hope to continue that growth at
my next job. I don't want to stagnate, I want to have the skills to work on really
cool projects and do really great things.

I want to be in a place where help can be found. In a similar vein as above, I want
to learn. I've become incredibly self sufficient at fixing my problems, but oftentimes
five or ten minutes with a more experienced developer will pay off incredible dividends.
Just the way that other people approach problems is fascinating to learn from and see
the tools and techniques they use, which I can then turn around and use on my own work.

I want to be around people who are as excited as I am. Learning to code was the best
decision I have ever made. I didn't know I could enjoy anything so much or that I
would enjoy the incredible amount of time that I've put into it. I love the
thrill of getting tests to pass that have been failing all morning. I love finding
a new tool to implement and learning about new technologies. Most of all, I love
being in an environment where everyone else is as stoked about it as I am. I want to
dive into an environment like that and soak in as much knowledge and skill as I
possibly can.

I don't know where I'll end up, but I'm really excited to see what happens over
the next few weeks.
