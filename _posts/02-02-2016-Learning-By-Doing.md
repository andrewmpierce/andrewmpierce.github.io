This weekend I learned a LOT of Rails. I had the great opportunity to help a friend of mine on a fairly large project she owns. When she initially asked if I'd be able to help her out, I wasn't sure if I had the knowledge and experience with Rails to actually be able to contribute to a codebase that people regularly use.Turns out that I totally can!

I spent the weekend setting up bulk emails and adding buttons to the front end so it's easy to send emails through the app. It was definitely a good assignment to get my hands in a lot of places. I was in the mailers, creating those, adding methods to a controller, reading through the models and schema to see the kind of information different objects had to be used in emails, and I spent time creating an email skeleton in the views. Finally I spent a lot of time troubleshooting in the config and initialize folders. I definitely plan to keep working through Rails Tutorial as its a much more gentle introduction and gives a lot of background information which is pretty nice to have. All in all, definitely a really productive weekend!

In other news, I start a new job tomorrow. I accepted a junior full stack position with AT&T that I'm incredibly excited about. The backend is in Perl and I'll be doing front end work as well with Javascript and AJAX and working with MySQL databases. I'm looking forward to adding a lot of new skills to my resume!
