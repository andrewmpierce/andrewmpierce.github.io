title: Maybe Open Offices Aren't Great?
comments: True

Lately I've been reading Peopleware, and one of the many things it talks about is how open offices aren't very productive. The Mythical Man Month said very similar things. People are more productive when they have their own space and can go longer amounts of time without getting distracted. This really goes against what most modern office planners seem to think. It's much more the norm now to have an open floor plan, than not.
