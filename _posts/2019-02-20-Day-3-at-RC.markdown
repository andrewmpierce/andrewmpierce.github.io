Today I paired with Gargi on creating a debugger from scratch in Go. I've never
even really looked at Go before and typically haven't done much with the types of syscalls
required to construct a debugger.

It was really fascinating! The basic premise is using `ptrace` to attach to another process
and be able to stop execution at the given breakpoint. This involves finding the correct address in
the assembly code of the target program and placing in a software interrupt, and from there,
being able to execute code and the other things that a debugger does.

We had some environment issues in the morning, but started making some decent headway
in the afternoon. We were able to `PTRACE_ATTACH` to a child process and `PTRACE_PEEKDATA`
to look at a random address. We ran into lots of interesting hurdles, and it was a
tiring but really beneficial day.

Tomorrow we plan to keep hacking on it!
