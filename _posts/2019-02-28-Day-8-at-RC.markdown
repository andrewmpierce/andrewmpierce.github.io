Today my goal for fnz is to make progress towards figuring out routing! It's one
of the must haves, even for micro frameworks, so I'm pretty excited to get into it.
My goal for right now is to emulate Sinatra with this basic style

```
get '/' do
  .. show something ..
end

post '/' do
  .. create something ..
end

put '/' do
  .. replace something ..
end

patch '/' do
  .. modify something ..
end

delete '/' do
  .. annihilate something ..
end
```

At this point I think that will mean defining methods for each of the HTTP request
types and being able to pass a route and block to those methods. I'm not 100%
sure of what the routing situation will look like when I'm done though. I think if
I just start getting into the weeds of it I'll start to see a path.
