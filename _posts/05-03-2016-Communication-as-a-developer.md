I've been at my current position for a little over a month now. I feel safe saying that I'm fairly into the daily swing of things and know what to expect day to day. I'm learning SO much every day, about my hard programming skills, but also quite a bit about my soft skills. As in, the way I interact with other developers in my work place, and even with customers who are asking for the changes that I implement every day.
