title: Apprenticeship Patterns, The Passionate Programmer, and what happened after

Lately I've really upped my productivity by reading during my lunch breaks at work.
I get an hour lunch and spend about 15-20 minutes eating, then find a secluded
corner to read something for the remaining 30-45 minutes. As a result, I finished
up Apprenticeship Patterns, by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, last week.

I had very intentionally read The Passionate Programmer and Apprenticeship Patterns
back to back. While Apprenticeship Patterns is focused on techniques to make the most
of your software apprenticeship (loosely translated as your time as a junior developer)
and The Passionate Programmer is about growing your career, they're in different,
but definitely overlapping realms.

Apprenticeship Patterns was great, and I learned a lot! Typically I've been going
over parts of books that really stuck out to me, but this time I thought I'd write
about what I did as a result of reading Apprenticeship Patterns and The Passionate Programmer.

Mostly, I did a lot of writing and thinking about what I want out of my career, both in
terms of my technical skills and in what I want from the wider tech community. I wrote
out a list of the things that I wanted to learn and do in the next year, and the things that
I was currently on track to do and learn in the next year. While I won't share my personal
list, it was definitely a great exercise that I got a lot out of.

As a practical result, I submitted conference talk proposals to three conferences
this weekend. I think the odds are pretty good that I won't get picked, but it was
definitely a great thing for me to do, and I feel good about making that small step
towards growing my career. I also started to work my way through learning some basic C
this past week. I don't expect to devote a huge amount of time to learning C, as I don't
expect to use it professionally (but hey! who knows, right?), I have kept on hearing
over and over about how useful a knowledge of C is. I'm working through Learn C the Hard
Way currently, and I'll probably pick up K&R at some point soon and work through that as
well.
