Another busy day! I spent the morning finishing a code sample and then my fiance and I went to look at a venue for our wedding this fall. Busy busy!

What I learned yesterday:
Again, I learned a lot of Perl and some Javascript yesterday.

What I'm going to do today:
My goal for the night is to do some more Rails stuff. I expect to finish the last few pages of Chapter 2 of Rails Tutorial and then get working on Chapter 3.

What I expect to learn:
I expect to start learning how to put together the basic pieces of a Rails app with scaffolding!
