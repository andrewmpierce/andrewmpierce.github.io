I missed a few days again. Today is the start of week 5 at RC! I think I'm going
to switch to a weekly format now. Week 4 was my least productive week so far in some
ways, I didn't really work on my framework. I did a lot of interview prep, which was
great, and I skimmed a textbook on Operating Systems and took a lot of notes.
In a few days I certainly didn't learn ALL the concepts in Operating Systems Concepts,
but I learned what mutexes and semaphores are and some basics about memory management
and other stuff. It was pretty cool and I think a pretty good use of my time to do
a fast and furious overview. I've also been using InterviewCake to prep myself and
working through one of Stephen Grider's courses on Udemy to work on some interview prep.

For Week 5 my goal is to buckle down and finish my framework enough that I can feel
good being 'done' with it. I have the basics of routing and some basic database
connection stuff done, and I think its feasible to get it to an okay state in the next
week.

I also intend on doing more interview prep stuff this week, as I think it will be
really valuable going into the second half of RC when I'll be really focusing more on
interviewing and what I want to be doing post RC.
