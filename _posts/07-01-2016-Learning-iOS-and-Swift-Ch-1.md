title: Learning iOS development and Swift! Chapter 1 Overview
comments: True
---

I made a New Year's Resolution to start learning something new. I'm still using and playing with Python pretty often, but I thought it would be a good experience for me to try to learn a new programming language, so I chose Swift. I have also been playing with Ruby a little bit, but I wanted something different. Swift is used in iOS/OS X development and is an alternative to Objective-C and C, which were the only options for a while in the iOS and OS X development world.

I chose to start learning and messing with Swift and iOS for several reasons. First and
probably most importantly, it just seems interesting! I like the idea of being able to
make things that could go directly into the app store. I think it will be an interesting experience to be locked in to tools like Xcode and see how that effects me.  I also am just
generally very interested in mobile development. It's obviously an already massive platform and growing more every day.

That being said, I've decided to make a blog post every time I make my way through a chapter and post about what I've learned.

The first chapter was about variables and a very basic overview of the Swift language. I learned that Swift is truly an object oriented language, from my very first musings, it reminds me a little of Ruby in that regard. I also learned about that it is a strongly typed language, meaning that types are explicitly stated. This has the benefit of making it type safe when compiled.

I also learned about the let and var keywords. They are both used to assign values, but let is used for constants, and var for variables. This in itself is unremarkable but I was intrigued to discover that when compiled, the compiler will warn you if you are using var when you could be using let, since let is apparently much more efficient.  

Overall, the rest seems similar to other concepts of object oriented programming that I already knew from Python. Looking forward to learning about functions in Swift tomorrow!
