I'm giving my first talk!

I'm really excited about this. It will be at a local meetup group, The Iron Yard API, and it will be about Web Accessibility. I've mulled over some of the major points I want to make, but I still need to make some slides. I will definitely make those available once I have them. It's July 14th, so I have a little bit of time to get everything prepared.

I've also submitted the talk idea to a few conferences, so keep your fingers crossed for me!
