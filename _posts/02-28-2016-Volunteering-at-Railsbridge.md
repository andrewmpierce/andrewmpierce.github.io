This weekend I had the opportunity to volunteer as a TA at RailsBridgeTri. RailsBridge is an organization that hosts weekend intro courses to Rails targeted at women. My partner, Ashley, came into programming through a RailsBridge event and is now the lead organizer of the local chapter (RailsBridgeTri) a year and a half later. Ashley is the one who introduced me to programming as well, so I have overwhelmingly warm feelings towards the organization.

RailsBridge is set up over two days. On Friday night we have InstallFest, where participants come and install all the necessary programs for a basic dev environment (Ruby, Git, Brew, Atom, etc.). For a minority of people this is a pretty straightforward process, but for a lot of people, it's pretty critical to have some devs wandering around to help troubleshoot the install process. Some people finish the install in twenty minutes, but a couple of people took close to three hours, through no real fault of their own.

The second day is spent working through building a polling app in Rails. There is curriculum posted online, and participants work through it independently and are encouraged to ask for help if they get stuck.

The event is targeted at people with zero programming experience who want to see what all the hype is about, so having a plethora of TA's wandering around helping people who encounter problems is an absolute must for a successful event.
