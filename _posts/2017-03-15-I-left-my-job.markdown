The title of this post is pretty straightforward. I left my job! I had been a contracted developer at AT&T for a little over a year and had done
really well there and learned a LOT. My last blog post was even about getting a promotion there. In terms of a first job in software engineering,
it was definitely difficult, but I learned an incredible amount and I'm very thankful for my time there and what I learned.

I had been debating leaving AT&T for a few months, and finally decided to just take the leap. I put in notice a few weeks ago and had my last day this
past Friday. I don't have a dev job lined up, and I'm not actively looking for one! My biggest reason for wanting to leave was that I simply wanted to
get into freelancing and work on some personal projects. I'm really intrigued by the mobile market and want to work on some projects full time and see
where and what they evolve into. I intend to spend a lot of time building out my portfolio in the coming months and learn some new technologies, and then
really expand into my own products and the freelancing market.

I loved working at AT&T and learned so much, but it didn't leave me a lot of creative juices left at the end of the day. I felt that by quitting and working
on myself and my skillset full time, I could make massive strides in my career. I'm really intrigued to see what the future will bring, but so far things have
been going really well.

In other news, I also accepted a position as a Teaching Assistant at UNC Coding Boot Camp! It came up pretty suddenly and was totally unplanned. I had
already put in notice with AT&T when I got a recruiting email from them. Several interviews later, I started as a TA on Monday! It's a part time program,
so it is actually the perfect situation for me. I have lots of extra time to work on what I quit my job to do, but still have some set commitments to keep
me honest. I intend to write a longer post about the TA gig, but suffice to say, I'm really really really excited about it.
