fnz is going well! Today I wrote some aspirational docs, basically I just outlined
the interface that I want my users to work with later. It was definitely helpful
for me to have a better roadmap for the features I want to implement. I did a lot
of work to clean up my big mess of Ruby web application into several helper classes.
Right now I just have the helper classes in a `gem` folder, but I'm thinking next
next week I will see if I can package those as a gem. I've never actually done
that before and I think it will be a nice learning experience.

I'm getting closer and closer to real framework!
