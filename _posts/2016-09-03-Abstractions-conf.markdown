I got back from Abstractions in Pittsburgh about two weeks ago. It was my first time being able to go to tech
conference, and it was great! I came back feeling really energized about software development, and I
was able to talk to a lot of great people in the industry. My current job doesn't give any kind of conference
benefit, so I was the only person from my office there. In general, its unfortunately not really part of our office culture to go to conferences. However I did actually see and meet a few developers from the RDU area, so that was pretty awesome.

The talks were great. In general I really enjoy listening to conference talks on Youtube as I'm driving to work or wherever else, and it was great to hear some people in person that I've heard in my car so often. I got to hear talks from Aaron Patterson and Sean Griffin and Laurie Voss and Sandi Metz. I really enjoy just being surrounded by so many smart and passionate people. It really is very cool to see this side of the development community.

The greatest part by far was the networking and just getting to shake so many hands and share so many beers. I work in Perl every day, and I got a chance to meet and speak with Larry Wall briefly, which was pretty sweet. I got to have lunch with developers from all over the country learn about what different places are doing and just meet a lot of like minded people and talk about writing code and creating cool products.

Overall, I just really appreciated the boost of confidence and inspiration. I love to write code every day at my job, but I tend to forget how big the industry is and how much is constantly going on. It's an awesome experience to be able to go and make all these connections and really feed off the energy from the conference. I'm very excited to keep going to conferences and network and keep growing in my career.
