I woke up really tired today. Pairing all day the yesterday on something totally new
to me and the general overwhelmingness of RC probably caught up to me. That aside,
Gargi and I returned to the world of `ptrace` and Go. It's definitely the kind of
project where it doesn't feel like we're making that much concrete progress, but
I at least am definitely learning a lot just by messing around with it.

Today we were able to write some Go that kicked off a simple script
and prints out the number 1 through 100 with a 1 second sleep between each number.
We then grab the pid of the counter script, and `PTRACE_ATTACH`. Then we
wait for the counter script to stop and at this point we should theoretically be
able to do things with our traced process. We hit a lot of issues though. We had
problems were, after waiting, the counter process couldn't be found by its pid, and
didn't appear to be executing, as we couldn't see any of the output it should have
been printing to the command line. Our goal had been to use `PTRACE_SINGLESTEP` once
the program had stopped to be able to step through a few instructions, but we had a
lot of trouble getting it to work. Yesterday we were able to attach and look at different
registers, so we were both a bit confused. We messed around with this for a bit but didn't
make any huge breakthroughs.

I've learned a lot about debuggers and `ptrace`, but I'm also excited to shift
tomorrow to working on my web stuff a bit more.

Gargi and I read through [this series on debuggers](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/01/23/how-debuggers-work-part-1/) and
it was super helpful! I think we are tentatively planning on returning to this on
Monday.
