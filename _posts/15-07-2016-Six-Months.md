I've officially been at AT&T as a full stack developer for a little over six months. The time has truly flown
by. I've loved my first six months as a professional developer, and really looking forward to the rest of
my career. I've learned a few things along the way that I thought I'd share.

1) Learning the code base is the hardest part.

Depending on how big and hairy the code base you're diving into is, it definitely takes some
time to figure out what's going on with it. If I see a weird bug in the browser, where is this
happening? What kind of APIs are we pulling from that could be giving us back a weird response?
What database tables are we using to get the information we need, and what kind of values
do they expect? What new features have we rolled out recently and how could they cause problems?

Having a general idea of at least parts of the code base and how these things factor in make debugging
a much faster and easier process. If you have an idea of potential failure points surrounding break you're
working on fixing, you have a great checklist to go down before you start working on the really crazy potential
problems.

When it comes to writing new features, knowing the code base is just as beneficial. Its
