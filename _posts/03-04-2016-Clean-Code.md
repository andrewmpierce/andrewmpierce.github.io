I just finished reading Clean Code, by Uncle Bob. While the entire book was pretty great and had a lot of great code examples to read and learn from, I got a lot out of four chapters in particular.

My favorite chapter, and the chapter with the easiest immediate implementation, was Ch. 2, Meaningful Names.

Good naming is the quickest way to more readable, and therefore more maintainable, clean code. It made a lot of sense when Uncle Bob said we should think of ourselves as authors, and our code should be as close to reading a book as possible. Our code should do what you'd expect from the name. While that seems simple, it is pretty easy to get into a habit of lazy naming. If we're writing code only for ourselves, it's easy to convince ourselves that this single letter variable name is fine, right? I mean, I know what it means and stands for but no one else is ever going to read this code.
