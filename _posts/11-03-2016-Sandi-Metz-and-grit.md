One of my favorite local meetups to go to is (Triangle.rb)[http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/].
As the name suggests, it's a meetup for local Rubyists. Ruby is a language that I'm trying to
learn more of, and I love the Ruby and Rails community. Triangle.rb has speakers every month,
and after a cancellation this month, Sandi Metz filled in!

If you don't know who Sandi Metz is, she's a very well known figure in the Ruby community.
She's most famous for POODR (Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby), which is frequently
touted as one of the best Ruby or Object Oriented Design books to read. Put simply, Sandi Metz is great,
and you should read POODR and go to her talks if you're able.

So Sandi lives in Durham and has actually given at least one talk before at Triangle.rb. While I wasn't
able to go to her last talk, hearing her this past week was completely amazing. Her talk was called
"Grit: 100 Miles of Hill". If this doesn't sound like a technical talk, it's because it wasn't one.
Sandi's talk was about the importance of grit, pretty much in life in general. Sandi is also an avid cyclist,
and the talk interweaves the stories of her both writing POODR, and racing in the Bridge to Bridge, a
grueling century ride with close to 10,000 ft. of elevation gain. She also talks in depth about
research into the quality of 'grit'.

While I can't claim to have done anything that requires as much grit as Sandi clearly possesses, learning to
code has absolutely taught me the importance of grit. I don't believe that there are 'natural programmers'.
Mostly I think there are people who have been programming longer than others, and have learned more tricks and
have simply put in more hours to the craft.

Sometimes I find myself discouraged with how little I know about programming and development. I work so hard,
but more experienced developers can do things in 10 minutes that would literally take me days to
figure out, if I was able to at all. That can definitely be frustrating, but I have to remind myself that that
developer can do it in ten minutes because they've done this exact same thing fifteen times in their career!
There's a good chance that the first time they tried, it took them days to finish.
